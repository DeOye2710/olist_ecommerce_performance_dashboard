🛒 Olist E-commerce Performance Dashboard
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales, customer, and seller performance on the Olist e-commerce platform.
The analysis is built from eight(8) CSV datasets, which were cleaned, transformed, and connected in Power BI using Power Query to create a unified data model. These datasets covered different aspects of the business — including orders, payments, sellers, customers, products, reviews, and geolocation data — and were merged to enable a holistic view of the company’s operations.
The dashboard explores revenue trends, customer retention, seller activity, and product ratings to uncover actionable insights that drive smarter business decisions.
It is fully interactive and organized into three analysis pages, each designed to provide a clear view of the company’s performance across multiple dimensions.
